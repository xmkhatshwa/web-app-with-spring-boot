Spring Boot Tutorial For Beginners
* [Installing IntelliJ, Maven and Java](#installing-tools)

### Introduction

Spring Boot has a lot of magic going for it. Developing Services with it is cool and fun.

Spring Boot makes it easy to create stand-alone, production-grade Spring based Applications that you can “just run”. Most Spring Boot applications need very little Spring configuration.

In this project, you will learn the cool things about Spring Boot.

### Goals
- Provide quick start for projects with Spring.
- Be opinionated but provide options.
- Provide a range of non-functional features that are common to large classes of projects (e.g. embedded servers, security, metrics, health checks, externalized configuration).
- Absolutely no code generation and no requirement for XML configuration.

### Expectations
- You should know Java. You should understand usage of Annotations.
- You should understand the basics of Spring framework.
- A basic understanding of JPA, Spring Security will be useful.
- You are NOT expected to have any experience with Eclipse or Maven.
- We will help you install IntelliJ and get up and running with Maven.
